Test the programs:
******************

Before running the programs, compile the source file:
    linux> make
Running the programs:
    linux> make run

It will run the executable files with test case written in advance automatically and write the output to stdout.
Or you can:
    linux> make tolog
It will run the executable files with test case written in advance automatically and write the output to log.
But it is impossible to show the color in log.
