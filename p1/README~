******************
Test the programs:
******************

Before running the programs, compile the source file:
    linux> make
Running the programs:
    linux> ./gcd
    linux> ./sort
    linux> ./prime
They will print the output. And for the prime program, you should input two integers and it will print the gcd of them.    

OR just type:
    linux> ./bin/test.sh
It will compile the source files and run the programs automatically.
